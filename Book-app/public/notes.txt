routing : Routing in React allows you to navigate between different pages (or views) in a single-page application (SPA) without needing a full page reload. React handles routing using a library called React Router or react router dom.

react router dom provide many router but recommended router is createBrowserRouter 


import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';  - only components will load inted of whole application reload  

import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';  - provide a router to route blw differnt component pages 

import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom"; - provide header and footer across all pages in application
